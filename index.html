            <p>Red attracts the most attention and is associated with strong emotions, such as love, passion, and anger.

            It’s the universal color to signify strength, power, courage, and danger. Red is vibrant, stimulating and exciting with a strong link to sexuality and increased appetites.</p>
        <p>

            Red is energizing and exciting, motivating us to act. It can also give confidence to those who are shy or lacking in willpower.

            It’s warm and positive, generally associated with our most physical needs and our will to survive. It exudes a strong and powerful masculine energy. It enhances metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure.

            Wear red to energize the group or the meeting but in smaller patches of the outfit, such as a blouse or scarf. It also does wonders to uplift your mood in a dark green, grey, black and navy basic ensemble. Red ties are also favored by politicians as part of the red and blue tie partnership they wear with everything.

            A little can go a long way, however, and in large areas red can cause visual strain. Wearing it too much, too often can brand you as a person in charge, but also as a bossy person!

            <h1>The door</h1>
            <p id="author">by Miroslav Holub</p>
            <p id="p5">
                Go and open the door.
                Maybe outside there’s
                a tree, or a wood,
                a garden,
                or a magic city.
                
                Go and open the door.
                Maybe a dog’s rummaging.
                Maybe you’ll see a face,
                or an eye,
                or the picture
                of a picture.
                
                Go and open the door.
                If there’s a fog
                it will clear.
                
                Go and open the door.
                Even if there’s only
                the darkness ticking,
                even if there’s only
                the hollow wind,
                even if
                nothing
                is there,
                go and open the door.
                
                At least
                there’ll be
                a draught.
